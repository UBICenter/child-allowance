<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In developing contexts, there is a large volume of literature on the efficacy of cash transfers in improving child outcomes. In particular, in recent times, countries in Africa have routinely been the site of rigorously evaluated nation-wide cash transfer schemes targeted at children, such as the Zambian Child Grant Program (CGP). Moreover, international organizations, such as GiveDirectly, have staged and evaluated their own interventions, creating a rich comparative literature on the impacts of cash transfers.</p>
<p>This report summarizes the existing literature from Africa on the impacts of cash transfers on metrics of food security, health, educational attainment, material deprivation and sex and gender-related outcomes. Thereby, it seeks to provide an indication of the breadth (in terms of the types of outcomes that it effects) and scale of the impacts of cash transfers on child outcomes and reflect on their efficacy as an intervention to improve child outcomes.</p>
<p>In reporting the results of evaluations, an asterix is included after each statistically significant coefficient at the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha = 0.10\)</span> significance level. Additional asterixes are reported at each threshold significance level (* = 0.10, ** = 0.05, *** = 0.01).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="studies-considered-to-be-completed">
<h1>Studies Considered [TO BE COMPLETED]<a class="headerlink" href="#studies-considered-to-be-completed" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This report considers 23 studies, including XX country-wide interventions. The majority, XX, were not targeted at children, while XX were, providing a means to compare how targeting changes the impact of programs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="food-security-and-nutrition">
<h1>Food security and nutrition<a class="headerlink" href="#food-security-and-nutrition" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Households that received a cash transfer tended to spend significantly more money consuming food and these households tended to benefit from greater diversity in their diet. There is some weak evidence of improvements in household food security and an increase in the number of meals eaten each day by children.</p>
<p>The change in food consumption as a percentage of the total transfer was high across most interventions. For example, a 2018 World Bank Meta-analysis {cite} <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">World_Bank_meta</span></code> found that the cash transfer elasticity of food consumption was high across Zambia’s CGP (110%**) Malawi SCTP (148%**) and the Kenya CT-OVC (60%**). On the other hand, some transfers, and most often smaller or irregular transfers, such as the Ghana LEAP and Lesotho CGP, had no impact on food consumption. Across the meta-analysis subjects, for each dollar transferred, average household food consumption increased by 36 cents.</p>
<p>This increase in household food consumption is reflected in more concrete measures of nutritional outcomes for recipient households. The number of meals eaten per day unilaterally increased across the programs that measured it: 0.23*** in the Ethiopian SCTPP, 0.09*** in the Ghana LEAP and 0.29** in the Malawi SCTP. Similarly, the proportion of people consuming more than one meal per day increased 11** percentage points in the Zambian MCTG.</p>
<p>However, the evidence on other measures of food security is less clear. Dietary diversity improved in the Ghana LEAP***, Kenya HSNP*** and Lesotho CGP**, while null effects were found in the Kenya CT-OVC and Kenya GiveDirectly programs.</p>
<p>Looking specifically at child outcomes, there is some evidence that children in households that received cash transfers skip fewer meals. The Uganda GiveDirectly program found that the proportion of children skipping meals fell 19.3 percentage points*** but the Lesotho CGP found no effect on the same metric.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="nutrition-long-term-impacts">
<h1>Nutrition Long-term impacts<a class="headerlink" href="#nutrition-long-term-impacts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>There is little evidence on the longer-term impact of cash transfers on child health outcomes associated with better childhood nutrition. While the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.poverty-action.org/sites/default/files/publications/Benchmarking.pdf">GiveDirectly Rwanda</a> found small positive impacts of transfers on Height-for-age and Weight-for-age (0.091** standard deviations and 0.067** standard deviations respectively), as did the South African CGP, most other evaluations did not find significant impacts, likely because the anthropomorphic benefits of nutrition take extended periods to materialise. Perhaps concerningly, in the Lesotho CGP evaluation, a significant reduction in Weight-for-age was found amongst program recipients, though there was no corresponding increase in the proportion of children suffering from malnutrition.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="health">
<h1>Health<a class="headerlink" href="#health" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Despite improving medium-term health outcomes being a central aim of many cash transfers, there is little evidence that household expenditure on health-related services increases with receipt of a cash transfer. While the Burkino Faso NCTPP and Malawi SCTP report significantly higher utilization of healthcare services (and particularly curative services) on receipt of the transfer, the World Bank meta-analysis finds no significant divergence in mean expenditure on health services.</p>
<p>Both the Malawi SCTP (-0.06** pp) and the South African CGP find signficant reductions in self-reported illness or injury after receipt of a transfer, though the Ghana LEAP showed no similar effect. Across a broad range of health-related outcomes, there is very little evidence that cash transfers directly improve health outcomes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sanitation-facilities">
<h1>Sanitation facilities<a class="headerlink" href="#sanitation-facilities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Cash transfers appear to have a limited impact on the availability of sanitation facilities such as safe drinking water, toilets and hand-washing facilities. The Ghana LEAP found no significant impact across all three outcome areas.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mental-health">
<h1>Mental health<a class="headerlink" href="#mental-health" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>There is little evidence that cash transfers impact the mental health of recipients and their communities. While the GiveDirectly Kenya program found a positive*** impact on a village-level psychological well-being index, the Malawi SCTP, Tanzania TSAF and Zambia MCTG all reported null results.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="education">
<h1>Education<a class="headerlink" href="#education" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>There is some evidence that receipt of a cash transfer increases the probability that a child is enrolled in school. For example, the Malawi SCTP found that receipt of the transfer was associated with an 11 pp*** increase in enrollment from baseline and the Zambian MCTG an 8 pp* increase. There is also evidence from the Burkino Faso NCTPP that while enrollment increases for transfers conditional on child attendance, there is no effect for unconditional transfers. However, evidence from the Ghana LEAP is mixed, with significant results for pre-school enrollment significant but not for older children, and there was a null effect found for the Kenya CT-OVC. In its totality, the evidence likely indicates a small improvement in enrollment outcomes.</p>
<p>On the intensive margin, there is some evidence that school attendance increases on receipt of the transfer (e.g. 20%** Burkino Faso NCTPP, 10% Ghana LEAP) though other programs find small negative impacts (Sierra Leone CFW -4%) and the World Bank meta-analysis finds no significant impact across the programs. Similar mixed results are reported by these programs for grade attainment.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/159871468272378854/pdf/WPS5259.pdf">Malawi’s ZCTP</a> also found improvements in varied scores of educational attainment and cognition for its conditional transfer program (which required school attendance), but not the unconditional transfer program (on average, roughly 0.15*** sd improvements). This may indicate that if educational outcomes are the primary purpose of the cash transfer intervention, then conditioning the transfer on school attendance may be a more cost-efficient intervention. There is, however, evidence that these education effects are <a class="reference external" href="https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/ow2_147_malawi_2302_-top.pdf">not persistent</a> once transfers stop.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="material-deprivation">
<h1>Material deprivation<a class="headerlink" href="#material-deprivation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>To determine whether increases in household expenditure translate to improvements in the material well-being of children, many programs measure changes in child ownership of basic items, namely, a pair of shoes, a blanket and a spare set of clothing. There were highly significant results across the majority of evaluations that considered child deprivation metrics, reflecting households’ tendency to spend transfers on meeting the material needs of children as well as the potential efficacy of cash transfers as an intervention to improve the material wellbeing of children.</p>
<p>The Ghana LEAP reporting a 10 percentage point*** increase in ownership of shoes and a change of clothes, the Malawi SCTP reporting roughly 30*** percentage point increases in ownership of blankets and shoes and the Zambia MCTG reporting 20*** pp increases in blankets and shoes and a 5** pp increase in change of clothes. That said, in the Tanzania TASAF evaluation, the only significant impact found was in possession of a pair of shoes (0.11** pp).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="child-labour">
<h1>Child Labour<a class="headerlink" href="#child-labour" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The studies considered showed no evidence of reductions in child labour associated with provision of a cash transfer. While the Kenya CT-OVC found a modest reduction (-12%***) in own-farm labour, the vast majority of studies found no effect of cash transfers on child labour incidence. Indeed, the Malawi SCTP found a 0.09 pp*** increase in child labour incidence. This is reflected in the World Bank meta-analysis, which found no significant effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sex-and-gender-related-outcomes">
<h1>Sex and gender-related outcomes<a class="headerlink" href="#sex-and-gender-related-outcomes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In recent years there has been substantial interest in whether cash transfers, particularly if they are given to women recipients, improve metrics of women’s empowerment. As yet, there is little evidence that cash tranfers improve women’s empowerment.</p>
<p>The majority of studies reported the incidence of marriage and pregnancy amongst female-identifying recipients. For example, The <a class="reference external" href="http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/159871468272378854/pdf/WPS5259.pdf">Malawi ZCTGP</a> reported large reductions in the likelihood of marriage and pregnancy, 48%*** and 34%*** respectively, and the Kenya CT-OVC reported a 4.9 percentage point reduction in the incidence of pregnancy among cash transfer recipients and a null result for marriage. However, the majority of studies, including the Ghana LEAP, Malawi SCTP and ZCTP, and Tanzania TASAF reported null effects.</p>
<p>Across less commonly reported metrics such as empowerment indicies, the usage of modern contraceptives and incidence of sex and gender-based violence, the evidence is similarly weak. While the Kenya GiveDirectly program reported improvements in an index of women’s empowerment*** and a reduction in both physical violence*** and sexual violence** indices for female recipients, there were null results in similar outcome metrics across the Ghana LEAP, Tanzania TASAF and Zambia MCTG.</p>
