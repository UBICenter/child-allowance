# The impact of cash transfers on child outcomes in Africa

### Introduction
In developing contexts, there is a large volume of literature on the efficacy of cash transfers in improving child outcomes. In particular, in recent times, countries in Africa have routinely been the site of rigorously evaluated nation-wide cash transfer schemes targeted at children, such as the Zambian Child Grant Program (CGP). Moreover, international organisations, such as GiveDirectly have staged and evaluated their own interventions, creating a rich comparative literature to understand the breadth (what outcomes they affect) and scale (the magnitude of those effects) of program impacts and the mechanisms through which cash transfers create change.

Here, we seek to provide an overview of the existing evidence of cash transfer interventions across Africa to reflect on the efficacy of cash transfers as an intervention to improve child outcomes. Standard errors are reported in brackets and an asterix is reported after each statistically significant coefficient at the $\alpha = 0.10$ significance level. Additional asterixes are reported at each threshold significance level (* = 0.10, ** = 0.05, *** = 0.01). 

### Food security and nutrition
The change in food consumption as a percentage of the total transfer was high across most interventions. For example, a 2018 World Bank [meta-analysis](http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/657581531930611436/122290272_201809295093309/additional/128594-PUB-PUBLIC.pdf) found that the cash transfer elasticity of food consumption was high across Zambia's CGP (110%\*\*) Malawi SCTP (148\*\*) and the Kenya CT-OVC (60%\*\*). On the other hand, some transfers and most often smaller or irregular transfers, such as the Ghana LEAP and Lesotho CGP, had no impact on food consumption. Across the meta-analysis subjects, for each dollar transfered, average household food consumption increased by 36 cents. 

This increase in household food consumption is reflected in more concrete measures of nutritional outcomes for recipient households. There is broad evidence of improvements in dietary diversity such as in the [Lesotho CGP](https://transfer.cpc.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Lesotho-CGP-SPRINGS-Impact-Report_FINAL.pdf) and evidence of more stable food access. The [Zambia SCT](https://www.air.org/sites/default/files/downloads/report/RCT%20of%20SCTs_MCTG_24_month_report_Official.pdf), for example, increased the proportion of people consuming more than one meal per day by 11\*\* percentage points and numerous studies reported improvements in an index of food security (e.g. [GiveDirectly Kenya](https://www.princeton.edu/~joha/publications/Haushofer_Shapiro_UCT_QJE_2016.pdf), [GiveDirectly Rwanda](https://www.poverty-action.org/sites/default/files/publications/Benchmarking.pdf), [Zambia SCT](https://www.air.org/sites/default/files/downloads/report/RCT%20of%20SCTs_MCTG_24_month_report_Official.pdf)). Looking specifically at children, there is some evidence of percentage point reductions in the number of meals skipped by children in recipient households ([GiveDirectly Uganda](https://www.givedirectly.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Cash_Crop_Ugandan_CoffeeRCT.pdf), -1.93\*\*) but some programs found no impact ([Lesotho CGP](https://transfer.cpc.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Lesotho-CGP-SPRINGS-Impact-Report_FINAL.pdf)).

### Nutrition Long-term impacts
There is little evidence on the longer-term impact of cash transfers on child health outcomes associated with better child-hood nutrition. While the [GiveDirectly Rwanda](https://www.poverty-action.org/sites/default/files/publications/Benchmarking.pdf) found small positive impacts of transfers on Height-for-age and Weight-for-age (0.091** (0.045) standard deviations and 0.067** (0.036) standard deviations respectively), as did the South African CGP, most other evaluations did not find significant impacts, likely because the anthropomorphic benefits of nutrition take extended periods to materialise. However, in the Lesotho CGP evaluation, a significant reduction in Weight-for-age was found amongst program recipients, though there was no corresponding increase in the proportion of children suffering from malnutrition. There was a corresponding increase in dietary diversity which might reflect an increase in the nutrient-richness, or 'quality' of calories at the expense of quantity.

### Education

[Malawi's ZCTP](http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/159871468272378854/pdf/WPS5259.pdf), which provided cash transfers to non-married women aged 13-22, showed marked improvements in the number of terms across the seven term program for which girls were enrolled (0.14\*\*\*). On the intensive margin, there is some evidence that school attendance increases on receipt of the transfer (e.g. 20%** Burkino Faso NCTPP, 10% Ghana LEAP ) though other programs find small negative impacts (Sierra Leone CFW -4%)

[Malawi's ZCTP](http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/159871468272378854/pdf/WPS5259.pdf) also found improvements in varied scores of education attainment and cognition (in average, roughly 0.15*** sd improvements). There is however, evidence that these education effects are [not persistent](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/ow2_147_malawi_2302_-top.pdf) once transfers stop and similar programs did not find effects on test performance [Burkino Faso NCTPP](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254958803_Cash_Transfers_and_Child_Schooling_Evidence_from_a_Randomized_Evaluation_of_the_Role_of_Conditionality)

### Child Deprivation

### Sex and gender-based outcomes

[Malawi's ZCTP](http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/159871468272378854/pdf/WPS5259.pdf) found that the provision of an unconditional cash transfer reduced the incidence of marriage and pregnancy amongst recipients by 48% and 34% respectively.
