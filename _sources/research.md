# The impacts of cash transfers in sub-Saharan Africa

### Introduction

In developing contexts, there is a large volume of literature on the efficacy of cash transfers in improving child outcomes.
In particular, in recent times, countries in sub-Saharan Africa have routinely been the site of rigorously evaluated government and international organization-led interventions, creating a rich comparative literature on the impacts of cash transfers.

This report summarizes evidence from experimental and pseudo-experimental studies on the impacts of cash transfers on metrics of poverty, food security, health, educational attainment, child labour and empowerment-related outcomes.
Thereby, it seeks to provide an indication of both the range of outcomes affected by cash transfers and the magnitude of those effects.
Of course, the impacts of any intervention vary markedly between contexts, even between the programs and countries considered by this report.

In reporting the results of evaluations, an asterisk is included after each statistically significant coefficient at the $\alpha = 0.10$ significance level.
An additional asterisk is reported at each threshold significance level (* = 0.10, ** = 0.05, *** = 0.01). 

### Studies considered

*Note: Add the typical conditions, either here or in the outcome sections (e.g. any healthcare results should state if the CCT was conditioned on healthcare activities, and similarly for education)*

This report considers 20 programs spanning 11 countries:
13 pure unconditional cash transfers (UCTs), 
2 pure conditional cash transfers (CCTs), 
4 programs involving independent treatment arms that included both CCTs and UCTs, and one old age pension.
Table 1 shows the program title, country, conditionality, and a short-hand name by which we refer to each program throughout the report.

### Poverty 

Poverty metrics offer a simple means of estimating a household's capacity to provide for the material needs of its children.
Studies on cash transfers in sub-Saharan Africa tend to report 3 such metrics, namely changes in:

1. the poverty headcount, a measure the share of the population earning or consuming below a nationally-determined poverty line;
2. the poverty gap index, a measure of the intensity of poverty; and
3. the squared poverty gap, a measure of the severity of poverty that more heavily weights relatively poor households.

Against these three measures, there is clear evidence from the Ghana LEAP, Kenya HSNP, Malawi SCTP and Zambia CGP that cash transfers are effective tools in reducing the incidence, intensity and severity of poverty {cite}`Ghana_final` {cite}`Kenya_HSNP_final` {cite}`Malawi_SCTP_final` {cite}`Zambia_CGP_final` .
The Uganda SAGE found similar, though less statistically significant impacts by defining a poverty line with respect to consumption expenditure {cite}`Uganda_SAGE_final` .
That said, the Lesotho CGP and Zimbabwe HSCT evaluations found no significant effects on any measure of poverty {cite}`Lesotho_CGP` {cite}`Zimbabwe_HSCT_final` . 

The findings of these studies are summarized in Table 2, which shows the percentage point (pp) reduction in measures of poverty driven by each of the programs.
In its totality, the evidence indicates that cash transfers do reduce household poverty.

Table 2: Evidence from sub-Saharan Africa: Cash transfers reduce poverty

|Program       |Headcount (pp) |Poverty gap (pp) |Squared poverty gap (pp) |
|:------------:|:---------:|:----------:|:------------------:|
|Ghana LEAP    |-2.1\*\*    |10.3\*\*      |             |

### Child material deprivation

To determine whether increases in household income translate to improvements in the material well-being of children, many programs measure changes in child ownership of basic items, namely, a pair of shoes, a blanket and a spare set of clothing.
Most evaluations reported highly significant effects on child deprivation metrics, reflecting households' tendency to spend transfers on meeting the material needs of children, as well as the potential efficacy of cash transfers as an intervention to improve the material wellbeing of children.

All programs that reported on child shoe ownership found significant percentage point increases following the cash transfer.
The Ghana LEAP reported a 10 pp\*\*\* increase in ownership of shoes and a change of clothes, the Malawi SCTP reported a roughly 30 pp\*\*\* increase in ownership of both blankets and shoes, and the Zambia MCTG reported roughly 20 pp\*\*\* increases in ownership of blankets and shoes and a 5 pp\*\* increase in change of clothes {cite}`Ghana_final` {cite}`Malawi_SCTP_final` {cite}`Zambia_MCTG_final`.
That said, in the Tanzania TASAF evaluation, the only significant impact found was in possession of a pair of shoes (18** pp), which was a central goal of the transfer {cite}`Tanzania_TASAF_final`.
These findings are summarized in Table 3.

Table 3: Evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa: Cash transfers reduce child material deprivation

|Program          |Owns all (pp) |Blanket (pp) |Shoes (pp) |Change of clothes (pp) |
|:---------------|:------------:|:-----------:|:---------:|:---------------------:|
|Ghana LEAP       |              |             |10\*\*\*      |9.5\*\*\*                 |
|Malawi SCTP      |30.6\*\*\*       |29.2\*\*\*      |32.0\*\*\*    |                       |

|Zimbabwe HSCT    |26.1\*\*\*       |-            |25.1\*\*\*    |-                      |

### Food security and nutrition

There is also some evidence that cash transfers improve nutrition of children and other household members.
Households that received a cash transfer tended to spend significantly more money on food, and these households tended to benefit from greater diversity in their diet and more meals per day.

The change in food consumption as a percentage of the total transfer was high across most interventions.
For example, a 2018 World Bank meta-analysis found that the cash transfer elasticity of food consumption was high across Zambia's CGP (110%\*\*), Malawi's SCTP (148%\*\*), and Kenya's CT-OVC (60%\*\*) {cite}`World_Bank_meta`.
On the other hand, some transfers---most often smaller or irregular transfers, such as the Ghana LEAP and Lesotho CGP---had no impact on food consumption {cite}`Ghana_final` {cite}`Lesotho_CGP`.
Across all of the meta-analysis subjects, for each dollar transferred, average household food consumption increased by 36 cents\*\* {cite}`World_Bank_meta` . 

This increase in household food consumption is reflected in more concrete measures of nutritional outcomes for recipient households.
The number of meals eaten per day unilaterally increased across the programs that measured it:
0.09\*\*\* in the Ghana LEAP and 0.29\*\* in the Malawi SCTP {cite}`Ghana_final` {cite}`Malawi_SCTP_final`.
Similarly, the proportion of people consuming more than one meal per day increased 11\*\* percentage points in the Zambia MCTG and the majority of programs reported improvements in indices of food securty {cite}`Zambia_MCTG_final`.

However, the evidence on other measures of food security is less clear.
For example, dietary diversity improved in the Ghana LEAP\*\*\* and Malawi SCTP\*\*\*, while null effects were found in the Kenya CT-OVC {cite}`Ghana_final` {cite}`Malawi_SCTP_final` {cite}`CT_OVC`.
Looking specifically at child outcomes, there is mixed evidence on whether transfers reduced the the number of meals that children are forced to skip as a result of economic pressures.
The Uganda GiveDirectly program found that the proportion of children skipping meals fell 19.3 pp\*\*\* but the Lesotho CGP found no effect on the same metric {cite}`Uganda_GD_final` {cite}`Lesotho_CGP` .

### Nutrition long-term impacts 

These studies find little evidence on the longer-term impact of cash transfers on child health outcomes associated with better childhood nutrition.
The GiveDirectly Rwanda program found small positive impacts of transfers on Height-for-age and Weight-for-age (0.091 standard deviations\*\* and 0.067 standard deviations\*\*, respectively {cite}`RwandaGD`),
as did the South African CSG.
However, most other evaluations, including the Ghana LEAP and Zambia CGP, did not find significant impacts.
The Lesotho CGP evaluation even found a significant reduction in Weight-for-age amongst program recipients, though there was no corresponding increase in the proportion of children suffering from malnutrition {cite}`Lesotho_CGP`.

These small and inconsistent effects may result from the long delays between nutrition and its anthropomorphic benefits {cite}`SouthAfrica_CSG_final` {cite}`Ghana_final` {cite}`Zambia_CGP_final`.

There is also some evidence that the gender of the recipient affects the impact of cash transfers.
The South African Old Age Pension only had significant impacts on Weight-for-height for girls if their grandmother (and not grandfather) was eligible for the pension {cite}`SA_Duflo` . 

### Health

*TODO: Consider grouping health outcomes and describing this as healthcare, morbidity (maybe group with an above section),
and mental health. Also reconsider including non-child programs, maybe put in an appendix?*

Despite improving access to healthcare being a central aim of many cash transfers, there is little evidence that household expenditure on health-related services increases with receipt of a cash transfer.
The Burkino Faso NCTPP and Malawi SCTP report significantly higher utilization of healthcare services (and particularly curative services) on receipt of the transfer {cite}`BurkinaFaso_final` {cite}`Malawi_SCTP_final`.
However, the World Bank meta-analysis finds no significant divergence in mean expenditure on health services and both the Tanzania TASAF and Zimbabwe HSCT actually report decreased expenditure {cite}`World_Bank_meta` {cite}`Tanzania_TASAF_final` {cite}`Zimbabwe_HSCT_final` . 

There is similarly weak evidence of improvement across a range medium-term health outcomes.
The Kenya UBI found between 3 and 6 pp\*\* reductions in morbidity (depending on time-scale) {cite}`Kenya_UBI`, and the Malawi SCTP found a 6 pp reduction\*\*) `Malawi_SCTP_final`.
However, the majority of studies, including the Ghana LEAP and Uganda SAGE, found no similar effects {cite}`Ghana_final` {cite}`Uganda_SAGE_final`.
Looking specifically at child outcomes, there is tentative evidence from the Rwanda GD that large cash transfers are associated with very modest declines in child mortality of -1** pp and this tentatively positive evidence characterises what we know about the impact of cash transfers on a broad range of health-related outcomes {cite}`RwandaGD`. 

There is interesting, though inconclusive, evidence of mental health impacts.
Kenya GiveDirectly found a positive\*\*\* impact on a village-level psychological well-being index and the Kenya UBI found a significant decrease\*\*\* in depression on the CES scale {cite}`KenyaGD_domvio` {cite}`Kenya_UBI`.
By contrast, the Zimbabwe HSCT found a weakly significant increase in depression\* but a highly significant improvement in subjective well-being\*\*\*, while the Malawi SCTP, Tanzania TASAF and Zambia MCTG found null effects {cite}`Zimbabwe_HSCT_final` {cite}`Malawi_SCTP_final` {cite}`Tanzania_TASAF_final` {cite}`Zambia_MCTG_final` . 

### Education

*Note: this can have more causal language than "associated" right?*

There is some evidence that cash transfers increase the probability that a child is enrolled in school.
For example, the Malawi SCTP found that receipt of the transfer was associated with an 11 pp\*\*\* increase in enrollment from baseline and the Zambia MCTG an 8 pp\* increase {cite}`Malawi_SCTP_final` {cite}`Zambia_MCTG_final`.
There is also evidence from the Burkino Faso NCTPP that, while enrollment increases for transfers conditional on child attendance (17.9 pp\*\*\*), there is no effect for unconditional transfers {cite}`BurkinoFaso_School`.

*Note: are any of the below conditional on child attendance? If any other than NCTPP were, it'd be good to break out the UCTs into a single paragraph.*

However, the evidence isn't conclusive.
The Kenya CT-OVC and Ghana LEAP only found significant enrollment effects on children age 13 to 17 {cite}`Ghana_final` {cite}`Kenya_CT_OVC`.
The Zimbabwe HSCT found no enrollment effects, though the authors indicate that this could be due to loss of income-based scholarships {cite}`Zimbabwe_HSCT_final`.
Moreover, evidence from the Zambia CGP indicates that enrollment improvements did not persist: a 10 pp\*\* increase at 30 months declined to a non-significant 6 pp at 36 months.
In its totality, the evidence likely indicates a small improvement in enrollment outcomes. 

*TODO: Confirm attendance = days attended / total school days, and mention this.*

On the intensive margin, there is some weak evidence that transfers increase school attendance, as quantified as share of school days attended.
For example, the Burkina Faso NCTPP CCT arm increased attendance by 13.4 pp\*\*\* (its UCT arm found a null effect) and the Malawi SCTP raised attendance by  13 pp\*\* {cite}`BurkinoFaso_School` {cite}`Malawi_SCTP_final`.
However, most individual studies, as well as a World Bank meta-analysis, arrived at null attendance results {cite}`World_Bank_meta`.
The programs reported similarly mixed results on grade attainment.

*Note: How is grade attainment defined?*

Malawi's ZCTP also found that its CCT (which required school attendance) improved various scores of educational attainment and cognition by roughly 0.15\*\*\* standard deviations each, while its UCT did not significantly improve these outcomes {cite}`MZCTP`.
Combined with evidence from the Burkino Faso NCTPP, this suggests that CCTs conditioned on school attendance more cost-effectively improve educational outcomes than UCTs.
There is, however, evidence that these educational effects are once transfers stop {cite}`ZCTP_medium`.

*TODO: Missing word in sentence above*

### Child labor

*TODO: Define terms*

The studies considered found inconsistent evidence on the effects of cash transfers on child labor.
While the Kenya CT-OVC found a modest reduction (-12%\*\*\*) in own-farm labor, the vast majority of studies found no effect of cash transfers on child labor incidence {cite}`CTOVC_food`.
Indeed, the Malawi SCTP found a 9 pp*** increase in child labour incidence, with the majority of the increase in hazardous activities {cite}`Malawi_SCTP_final`.
The absence of evidence is reflected in the World Bank meta-analysis, which found no significant effect {cite}`World_Bank_meta`. 

### Empowerment

In recent years there has been substantial interest in whether cash transfers, particularly if they are given to women, improve metrics of women's empowerment.
As yet, there is little evidence that cash tranfers improve women's empowerment.

*Note: Use % or pp consistently, specify outcomes in final sentence*

The majority of studies reported the incidence of marriage and pregnancy amongst female-identifying recipients. For example, The UCT arm of the Malawi ZCTP reported large reductions in the likelihood of marriage and pregnancy, 48%\*\*\* and 34%\*\*\* respectively, and the Kenya CT-OVC reported a 4.9 pp** reduction in the incidence of pregnancy among cash transfer recipients and a null result for marriage {cite}`MZCTP` {cite}`HANDA201536` . The Ghana LEAP found a reduction in the probability of marriage for women from 12-24 years at baseline but not women 12-17 and no effect on pregnancy {cite}`Ghana_final`.
The majority of studies, including the Malawi SCTP, as well as the Tanzania TASAF reported null effects {cite}`Tanzania_TASAF_final` {cite}`Malawi_SCTP_final` {cite}.

Across less commonly reported metrics, such as empowerment indicies, the usage of modern contraceptives and incidence of sex- and gender-based violence, the evidence is similarly weak.
While the Kenya GiveDirectly program reported improvements in an index of women's empowerment\*\*\* and a reduction in both physical\*\*\* and sexual violence** indices for female recipients, there were null results in similar outcome metrics across the Ghana LEAP, Tanzania TASAF and Zambia MCTG {cite}`KenyaGD_domvio` {cite}`Ghana_final` {cite}`Tanzania_TASAF_final` {cite}`MZCTP` .

### Conclusions

While the evidence from sub-Saharan Africa is complex and difficult to interpret, it is clear that cash transfers significantly improve the lives of children that live in households that receive them.
In particular, these children are substantially less likely to be poor and more likely to have their material needs satisfied, and they also receive some educational and health benefits.
