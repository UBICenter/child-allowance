# The impacts of cash transfers in sub-Saharan Africa

### Introduction
In developing contexts, there is a large volume of literature on the efficacy of cash transfers in improving child outcomes. In particular, in recent times, countries in sub-Saharan Africa have routinely been the site of rigorously evaluated nation-wide cash transfer schemes targeted at children, such as the Zambian Child Grant Program (CGP). Moreover, international organizations, such as GiveDirectly, have staged and evaluated their own interventions, creating a rich comparative literature on the impacts of cash transfers.

This report summarizes evidence from experimental and pseudo-experimental studies on the impacts of cash transfers on metrics of poverty, food security, health, educational attainment, child labour and empowerment-related outcomes. Thereby, it seeks to provide an indication of the efficacy of cash transfers as an intervention to improve child outcomes. Of course, the impacts of any intervention vary markedly between contexts, even between the programs and countries considered by this report.

In reporting the results of evaluations, an asterix is included after each statistically significant coefficient at the $\alpha = 0.10$ significance level. An additional asterix is reported at each threshold significance level (* = 0.10, ** = 0.05, *** = 0.01). 

### Studies Considered 
This report considers 20 programs, which include 6 conditional cash transfers (CCTs) and 17 unconditional cash transfers (UCTs), with 4 programs involving independent treatment arms that were both CCTs and UCTs and a country-wide old age pension in South Africa. The programs span 11 countries and the program title, country, conditionality and a short-hand name by which we refer to it throughout the report are listed in Table 1.

### Poverty 
Poverty metrics offer a simple means of estimating the capacity of households to provide for the material needs of children that are part of it. They tend to report against 3 such metrics, namely changes in 1) the poverty head count, a measure the share of the population earning or consuming below a nationally-determined poverty line, 2) the poverty gap index, a measure of the intensity of poverty, and 3) the squared poverty gap, a measure of the severity of poverty that more heavily weights relatively poor households.

Against these three measures, there is clear evidence from the Ghana LEAP, Kenya HSNP, Malawi SCTP and Zambia CGP that cash transfers are effective tools in reducing the incidence, intensity and severity of poverty {cite}`Ghana_final` {cite}`Kenya_HSNP_final`{cite}`Malawi_SCTP_final`{cite}`Zambia_CGP_final`. The Uganda SAGE found similar, though less statistically significant impacts by defining a poverty line with respect to consumption expenditure {cite}`Uganda_SAGE_final`. That said, the Lesotho CGP and Zimbabwe HSCT evaluations found no effect on any measure of poverty {cite}`Lesotho_CGP` {cite}`Zimbabwe_HSCT_final`. 

The findings of these studies are summarized in Table 2, which shows the percentage point reduction in measures of poverty driven by each of the programs. In its totality, the evidence indicates that cash transfers do reduce household poverty.

### Child material deprivation
To determine whether increases in household income translate to improvements in the material well-being of children, many programs measure changes in child ownership of basic items, namely, a pair of shoes, a blanket and a spare set of clothing. There were highly significant results across the majority of evaluations that considered child deprivation metrics, reflecting households' tendency to spend transfers on meeting the material needs of children as well as the potential efficacy of cash transfers as an intervention to improve the material wellbeing of children.

All programs that reported on child shoe ownership found significant percentage point increases following the cash transfer. The Ghana LEAP reported a 10 percentage point\*\*\* increase in ownership of shoes and a change of clothes, the Malawi SCTP reported a roughly 30\*\*\* percentage point increase in ownership of both blankets and shoes and the Zambia MCTG reported roughly 20\*\*\* pp increases in ownership of blankets and shoes and a 5\*\* pp increase in change of clothes {cite}`Ghana_final` {cite}`Malawi_SCTP_final` {cite}`Zambia_MCTG_final` . That said, in the Tanzania TASAF evaluation, the only significant impact found was in possession of a pair of shoes (18** pp) {cite}`Tanzania_TASAF_final`. These findings are summarized in Table 2.

### Food security and nutrition
Households that received a cash transfer tended to spend significantly more money consuming food and these households tended to benefit from greater diversity in their diet. There is some weak evidence of improvements in household food security and an increase in the number of meals eaten each day by children. 

The change in food consumption as a percentage of the total transfer was high across most interventions. For example, a 2018 World Bank Meta-analysis found that the cash transfer elasticity of food consumption was high across Zambia's CGP (110%\*\*) Malawi SCTP (148%\*\*) and the Kenya CT-OVC (60%\*\*) {cite} `World_Bank_meta`. On the other hand, some transfers, and most often smaller or irregular transfers, such as the Ghana LEAP and Lesotho CGP, had no impact on food consumption {cite}`Ghana_final` {cite}`Lesotho_CGP`. Across all of the meta-analysis subjects, for each dollar transferred, average household food consumption increased by 36** cents {cite} `World_Bank_meta`. 

This increase in household food consumption is reflected in more concrete measures of nutritional outcomes for recipient households. The number of meals eaten per day unilaterally increased across the programs that measured it: 0.09\*\*\* in the Ghana LEAP and 0.29\*\* in the Malawi SCTP {cite}`Ghana_final` {cite}`Malawi_SCTP_final`. Similarly, the proportion of people consuming more than one meal per day increased 11\*\* percentage points in the Zambia MCTG and the majority of programs reported improvements in indices of food securty {cite}`Zambia_MCTG_final`. 

However, the evidence on other measures of food security is less clear. For example, dietary diversity improved in the Ghana LEAP\*\*\* and Malawi SCTP\*\*\*, while null effects were found in the Kenya CT-OVC {cite}`Ghana_final` {cite}`Malawi_SCTP_final` {cite}`CT_OVC` {cite}. Looking specifically at child outcomes, there is mixed evidence on whether transfers reduced the the number of meals that children are forced to skip as a result of economic pressures. The Uganda GiveDirectly program found that the proportion of children skipping meals fell 19.3 percentage points\*\*\* but the Lesotho CGP found no effect on the same metric {cite}`Uganda_GD_final` {cite}`Lesotho_CGP`.

### Nutrition Long-term impacts 
There is little evidence on the longer-term impact of cash transfers on child health outcomes associated with better childhood nutrition. While the GiveDirectly Rwanda found small positive impacts of transfers on Height-for-age and Weight-for-age (0.091\*\* standard deviations and 0.067** standard deviations respectively {cite} `RwandaGD`), as did the South African CSG, most other evaluations, including the Ghana LEAP and Zambia CGP, did not find significant impacts, likely because the anthropomorphic benefits of nutrition take extended periods to materialise {cite}`SouthAfrica_CSG_final` {cite} `Ghana_final` {cite} `Zambia_CGP_final` . 

There is also some evidence that the gender of the recipient is important in the impact of cash transfers. The South African Old Age Pension only had significant impacts on weight-for-height for girls if their grandmother (and not grandfather) were eligible for the pension {cite}`SA_Duflo`. 

Perhaps concerningly, in the Lesotho CGP evaluation, a significant reduction in Weight-for-age was found amongst program recipients, though there was no corresponding increase in the proportion of children suffering from malnutrition {cite} `Lesotho_CGP`. Overall though, if anything, the evidence indicates small improvements in anthropomorphic child outcomes and recipient gender may affect the scale of impacts.

### Health
Despite improving medium-term health outcomes being a central aim of many cash transfers, there is little evidence that household expenditure on health-related services increases with receipt of a cash transfer. The Burkino Faso NCTPP and Malawi SCTP report significantly higher utilization of healthcare services (and particularly curative services) on receipt of the transfer {cite} `BurkinaFaso_final` {cite} `Malawi_SCTP_final`. However, the World Bank meta-analysis finds no significant divergence in mean expenditure on health services and both the Tanzania TASAF and Zimbabwe HSCT actually decreased expenditure {cite} `World_Bank_meta` {cite} `Tanzania_TASAF_final` {cite} `Zimbabwe_HSCT_final`. 

Both the Malawi SCTP (-0.06** pp) and the South Africa CSG find signficant reductions in self-reported illness or injury after receipt of a transfer, though the Ghana LEAP showed no similar effect {cite} `Malawi_SCTP_final` {cite} `SouthAfrica_CSG_final` {cite} `Ghana_final`. Across a broad range of health-related outcomes, there is very little evidence that cash transfers directly improve health outcomes.

That said, there are interesting findings on the impact of programs on HIV risk factors and mental health outcomes. Programs find significant reductions in the number of sexual partners in the last month and incidences of unprotected vaginal sex (Kenya CT-OVC, Malawi ZCTP, South Africa CSG, Zimbabwe HSCT {cite} `CT_OVC_HIV` {cite} `MZCTP` {cite} `SouthAfrica_CSG_final` {cite} `Zimbabwe_HSCT_final`).

There is similarly mixed evidence on mental health impacts. Kenya GiveDirectly found a positive\*\*\* impact on a village-level psychological well-being index and the Kenya UBI found a significant decrease\*\*\* in depression on the CES scale {cite} `KenyaGD_domvio` {cite} `Kenya_UBI`. By contrast, the Zimbabwe HSCT found a weakly significant increase in depression\* but a highly significant improvement in subjective well-being\*\*\*, while the Malawi SCTP, Tanzania TASAF and Zambia MCTG found null effects {cite} `Zimbabwe_HSCT_final` {cite} `Malawi_SCTP_final` {cite} `Tanzania_TASAF_final` {cite} `Zambia_MCTG_final`. 


### Education
There is some evidence that receipt of a cash transfer increases the probability that a child is enrolled in school. For example, the Malawi SCTP found that receipt of the transfer was associated with an 11 pp\*\*\* increase in enrollment from baseline and the Zambia MCTG an 8 pp* increase {cite} `Malawi_SCTP_final` {cite} `Zambia_MCTG_final`. There is also evidence from the Burkino Faso NCTPP that, while enrollment increases for transfers conditional on child attendance, there is no effect for unconditional transfers {cite}`BurkinaFaso_final`. However, evidence from the Ghana LEAP is mixed, with significant results for pre-school enrollment significant but not for older children, and there was a null effect found for the Kenya CT-OVC {cite} `Ghana_final`. In its totality, the evidence likely indicates a small improvement in enrollment outcomes.

On the intensive margin, there is some evidence that school attendance increases on receipt of the transfer (e.g. 20%** Burkino Faso NCTPP, 10% Ghana LEAP {cite}`BurkinaFaso_final` {cite} `Ghana_final`) though the World Bank meta-analysis finds no significant impact across the programs. Similarly weak mixed results are reported by these programs for grade attainment. 

Malawi's ZCTP also found improvements in varied scores of educational attainment and cognition for its conditional transfer program (which required school attendance), but not the unconditional transfer program (on average, roughly 0.15*** sd improvements) {cite} `MZCTP`. This may indicate that if educational outcomes are the primary purpose of the cash transfer intervention, then conditioning the transfer on school attendance may be a more cost-efficient intervention. There is, however, evidence that these educational effects are once transfers stop {cite} `ZCTP_medium`. 


### Child Labour
The studies considered showed no evidence of reductions in child labour associated with provision of a cash transfer. While the Kenya CT-OVC found a modest reduction (-12%\*\*\*) in own-farm labour, the vast majority of studies found no effect of cash transfers on child labour incidence {cite} `CTOVC_food`. Indeed, the Malawi SCTP found a 0.09 pp*** increase in child labour incidence, with the majority of the increase in hazardous activities {cite}`Malawi_SCTP_final`. The absense of evidence is reflected in the World Bank meta-analysis, which found no significant effect {cite} `World_Bank_meta`. 


### Empowerment
In recent years there has been substantial interest in whether cash transfers, particularly if they are given to women recipients, improve metrics of women's empowerment. As yet, there is little evidence that cash tranfers improve women's empowerment.

The majority of studies reported the incidence of marriage and pregnancy amongst female-identifying recipients. For example, The UCT arm of the Malawi ZCTP reported large reductions in the likelihood of marriage and pregnancy, 48%\*\*\* and 34%\*\*\* respectively, and the Kenya CT-OVC reported a 4.9 percentage point reduction in the incidence of pregnancy among cash transfer recipients and a null result for marriage {cite} `MZCTP` {cite} `HANDA201536`. The Ghana LEAP found a reduction in the probability of marriage for women from 12-24 years at baseline but not women 12-17 and no effect on pregnancy {cite} `Ghana_final`. The majority of studies, including the Malawi SCTP, as well as the Tanzania TASAF reported null effects {cite} `Tanzania_TASAF_final` {cite}`Malawi_SCTP_final` {cite}.

Across less commonly reported metrics such as empowerment indicies, the usage of modern contraceptives and incidence of sex and gender-based violence, the evidence is similarly weak. While the Kenya GiveDirectly program reported improvements in an index of women's empowerment\*\*\* and a reduction in both physical violence\*\*\* and sexual violence** indices for female recipients, there were null results in similar outcome metrics across the Ghana LEAP, Tanzania TASAF and Zambia MCTG {cite} `KenyaGD_domvio` {cite} `Ghana_final` {cite} `Tanzania_TASAF_final` {cite} `MZCTP`.

## Conclusions
While the evidence from sub-Saharan Africa is complex and difficult to interpret, it is clear that cash transfers significantly improve the lives of children that live in households that receive them. In particular, these children are substantially less likely to be poor, more likely to have their material needs satisfied and receive some educational and health benefits.
